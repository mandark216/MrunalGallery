      <p class="card-text">Best Friends means different things to different people. Some insist that you can have only one best friend. Others assert that they have best friends for different aspects of their personalities.

        Whatever the precise definition, your best friend is the person who gets you. They understand who you are and what you are saying. The greatest distance cannot separate best friends. You will always feel a kinship with them, and be able to instantly continue the friendship even after not talking for many years.


        Dear friend, let me say
something on this special day
Though we are far apart,
You'll be always in my heart.

I cherish those moments,
our silly fights and funny talks
and how we grew together,
stayed united in grief and laughter.

May your face always light up with glee.
I wish you never ever feel empty.
I pray, may God be always by your side.
I want you to always lift up your head in pride.

My friend, on your birthday,
all I want to say
is that you mean the world to me
and you are more than just a friend to me.

<h1>Your the best one</h1>
Within you, I've found the perfect friend,
Someone I know will be there till the end,
And they're not just thoughts I hope will fulfill
But thoughts that will stand forever still.

      <p class="card-text">we had goldfish and they circled around and around
        in the bowl on the table near the heavy drapes
        covering the picture window and
        my mother, always smiling, wanting us all
        to be happy, told me, 'be happy Henry! '
        and she was right:it's better to be happy if you
        can
        but my father continued to beat her and me several times a week while
        raging inside his 6-foot-two frame because he couldn't
        understand what was attacking him from within.

        Whose beauty is comparable to an angel so divine;
        Shall I overlook your smiles that are so sweet?
        Just a glimpse of you knocks me off my feet.
        
        Shall I pass a day without seeing you?
        Or miss a chance to prove my feelings are true;
        Shall I think twice to win your heart?
        Living without you will tear me apart.Your gentle breath swifts right through the autumn’s call,
        Shall I confess this love or wait until the next fall?Or shall I die as a friend veiling these feelings for you?</p>
